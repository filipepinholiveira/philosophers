when have even:

time_to_die = time_to_eat + time_to_sleep + 10 miliseconds


when have odd:

time_to_die = time_to_eat * 2 + time_to_sleep + 10 miliseconds



1) odd sleep (time_to_eat / 2)
2) odd start take from right fork
even start take from left fork
3) all philosophers take from right fork, except for last one


idea: make all philosophers sleep at the start of the program ----> odd sleep (time_to_eat / 2) so the 1srt half will get the forks


thread for each philosophers
thread to check if any philosophers is dead (check last eat time)


Problems may apear:

if theres only 1 philosophers theres only 1 fork, wont be able to eat
be care of printf
create my own sleep funtion cause usleep is not precise
carefull about infinite loops
valgrind --tool=helgrind ./philosophers
